# Solar Tracker

## Description
Solar tracker is an application that uses fuzzy logic to control the position of the Solar Panel (with an attached servo motor). 
The servo motor is controlled by an arduino board which is controlled by the application developed in **MATLAB**. It uses a two valued membership function. Depending upon the signals received from the input sensors the fuzzy logic controller decides the direction of movement of the solar panel. The panel changes orientation on a single axis.
